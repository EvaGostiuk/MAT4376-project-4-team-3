## Interactive Newspaper Link
[Interactive Newspaper Link](https://vivante.itch.io/mat4376-project4)

## Newspaper PDF
The base newspaper used when creating the interactive version above can be found here: [Newspaper PDF](MAT4376_Project4_Team3_Newspaper.pdf). This is NOT the final version as audio and interactive aspects are not included. 

## How This Page Works

There are the following 3 sections we want to highlight within this file: 

  * **Algorithms**: This is where all of our anomaly detection algorithms are located, along with their respective code and visualizations.
  * **Data Cleaning**: This is where the subset and the 2 updated versions of the original dataset are located. Any changes we made to the dataset were logged as a new version and are located in this folder. 
  * **Visualizations**: This is where all of the visualizations for the project are located. The Visualization README.md contains organized links to the various sub-sections of each type of visualization.

## Visualizations
[Visualizations can be viewed HERE](Visualizations/README.md). This collection of images was included in the newspaper, as well as some initial visualizations we looked into at the beginning of the project. 


## Data Dictionary
[Data Dictionary can be viewed HERE.](MAT4376_Data_Dictionary_Sheet1.pdf) This collection of terms are those that were included within the newspaper, as well as some initial terms we looked into at the beginning of the project. 


## Tasks

Located in the "[Issues](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-4-team-3/issues)" section. Each task has an "assignee", or person by whom the task was completed by. Tasks with multiple assignees were completed in collaboration. There is a filter on the top right to look at specific assignees and what they have worked on.
