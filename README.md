## How This Page Works

There are the following 3 sections we want to highlight within this file: 

  * Algorithms: This is where all of our anomaly detection algoithms are located, along with its respective code and visualizations.
  *Data Cleaning: This is where the subset and the 2 updated versions of the original dataset are located. Any changes we made to the dataset was logged as a new version and is located in this folder. 
  * **Visualizations**: This is where all of the visualizations for the project are located. The Visualization README.md contains organized links to the various sub-sections of each type of visualization.


## Visualizations
[Visualizations can be viewed HERE](Visualizations/README.md). This collection of images are those that were included within the video, as well as some initial visualizations we looked into at the beginning of the project. 

## Data Dictionary
[Data Dictionary can be viewed HERE.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YChxFxhDPiaDYDHnIBSFnG-8AQ06vkoaUf_nCnQioMM/edit?usp=sharing) This collection of terms are those that were included within the newspaper, as well as some initial terms we looked into at the beginning of the project. 


## Tasks

Located in the "[Issues](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376/issues)" section. Each task has an "assignee", or person who the task was completed by. Tasks with multiple assignees were completed in collaboration. There is a filter on the top right to look at specific assignees and what they have worked on.
